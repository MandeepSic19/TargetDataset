# RefData_LC
This repository contains a .pcd file and codes (with reference values) to demonstrate the  calibration and optimization workflow. The full dataset used in the experiments contains proprietary information and cannot be shared publicly. The provided sample files match the structure and format of the original dataset, allowing demonstration of the pipeline steps. Access to the full dataset can be requested by contacting the author, subject to approval.Further,It is sufficient for validating the methodology and reproducing the computational pipeline.

A permanent archival snapshot of this repository and the methodology diagram is available on Zenodo:  
- Repository DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXXX  
- Methodology Diagram DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.YYYYYYYY

## Overview
This repository also includes a  `.pcd` file along with the codes which is a representative of the full dataset.  
- Preprocessing, calibration, and optimization workflows are demonstrated using this sample file.  
- Full experimental setup, hardware specifications, and preprocessing parameters are described in the associated publication.

Only sample `.pcd` files are included. Full dataset access is available upon request.

## Sample Images
Sample images of point clouds and measurement outputs are available in `/figures/`.  
For detailed experimental results and analysis, refer to the associated publication.

## Reproducibility Information
The repository provides reference codes and sample data that are sufficient to reproduce the reported workflow and results.  
- Sample file formats match the original dataset to enable reproduction of the pipeline.  
- Hardware specifications, software details, and optimization parameters are documented in the associated publication.  
- The methodology diagram archived on Zenodo supports reproducibility and authorship verification.

## Methodology Diagram
The methodology diagram illustrates the calibration and optimization workflow and may be used alongside the reference code to reproduce the pipeline.
