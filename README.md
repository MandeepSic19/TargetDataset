# RefData_LC

This repository contains **sample data** and **reference code** to demonstrate the calibration and optimization workflow. The **full dataset** used in the experiments contains proprietary information and **cannot be shared publicly**. The provided sample files match the structure and format of the original dataset, allowing demonstration of the pipeline steps. Access to the full dataset can be requested by contacting the author, subject to approval.

A **permanent archival snapshot** of this repository and the **methodology diagram** is available on Zenodo:  
**DOI for repository:** `https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXXX`  
**DOI for methodology diagram:** `https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.YYYYYYYY`

## Dataset Overview
This repository includes **sample `.pcd` files** representative of the full dataset.  
- Preprocessing, calibration, and optimization workflows are demonstrated using these sample files.  
- **Full experimental setup, hardware specifications, and preprocessing parameters** are described in the associated publication.  

Only sample `.pcd` files are included here. Full dataset access is available **upon request**.

## Sample Images

Representative images illustrating sample point clouds and measurement outputs are available in the `/figures/` folder. For detailed experimental results and analysis, please refer to the publication.

---

## Reproducibility Information
The repository provides **reference code and sample data** that are sufficient to reproduce the reported results.  

- The structure and format of the sample files match the original dataset, enabling reproduction of the pipeline workflow.  
- **Full hardware specifications, software details, and optimization parameters** are described in the publication.  

The **methodology diagram**, archived on Zenodo, can be used alongside the reference code to reproduce the pipeline workflow.
