# RefData_LC

This repository provides a `.pcd` file and codes that demonstrate the calibration and optimization workflow used in the associated work. No experimental material is publicly shared; the resources provided here reflect the structure and format necessary to reproduce the computational workflow described in the manuscript.

## Overview
This repository includes:  
- A `.pcd` file representing the format used in the research  
- MATLAB codes for calibration and optimization workflows  
- Reference values for calibration parameters  

**Note:** The program includes representative reference values in place of actual experimental values to demonstrate reproducibility while preserving confidentiality.

These resources demonstrate the processing sequence used in the experiments. Additional setup information, hardware specifications, and preprocessing parameters are described in the associated manuscript.

## Images and Outputs
Representative images of point clouds and outputs are located in `/figures/`. For detailed experimental results and analysis, refer to the published manuscript.

## Reproducibility Information
The materials provided here support reproducibility of the computational workflow and results reported in the manuscript:  
- File formats match those used in the original experiments  
- Code reflects the calibration and optimization steps described in the publication  
- Hardware and software configuration details are included in the manuscript  
- The methodology diagram on Zenodo supports understanding of the workflow and confirms authorship of the process design  

These resources are intended for reproducing the workflow and validating the methodology.

## Methodology Diagram
The methodology diagram illustrates the calibration and optimization workflow and is intended to be used with the reference code to reproduce the computational process.
